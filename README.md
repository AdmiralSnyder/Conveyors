# Conveyors
this is a playground thing for the famous Conveyors challenge.
i use wpf canvas

each conveyor has its own thread, incrementing the age of the items. then linear interpolation
in the .gif there's only one conveyor right now, but you can add an arbitrary amount.

warnings. i have put _zero_ effort into decoupling logic from ui ... because it's late and all that.
