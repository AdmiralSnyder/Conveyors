Fix Selection stuff
- select a thing using the mouse, have it highlighted. --> SelectionManager

- select a thing from a dropdown, like the properties window in VS
- target a thing for an inputter (for example, a line in the line inputter)  --> TargetObjectManager

LATER
- allow for multiselect
--> one of the multiselected things is the main thing so it has a different highlight
- allow for hierarchical selection
- later allow for grouping...
- TODO expand the point to 3d in the first place, but only use x and y for 2d and use z for "layer" for now...
